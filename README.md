# Bloombox API Clients

This repository combines each of the [Bloombox](https://bloombox.io) API clients into one place for easy access. There are multiple integration options with Bloombox, including low-level gRPC-based APIs, and these libraries, which present a more fluid interface for reaching those same APIs.

Supported services:
- **Shop API** - operations like shop hours, zipcode eligibility checking, member verification and enrollment, etc
- **Telemetry API** - low-drag API for transmission/ingest of telemetry event data

Currently, packages are available for:
